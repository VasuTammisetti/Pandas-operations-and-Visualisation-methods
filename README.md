# Pandas-operations-and-Visualisation-methods

matplotlib is the O.G. of Python data visualization libraries. Despite being over a decade old, it's still the most widely used library for plotting in the Python community. It was designed to closely resemble MATLAB, a proprietary programming language developed in the 1980s.

Because matplotlib was the first Python data visualization library, many other libraries are built on top of it or designed to work in tandem with it during analysis. Some libraries like pandas and Seaborn are “wrappers” over matplotlib. They allow you to access a number of matplotlib’s methods with less code.

While matplotlib is good for getting a sense of the data, it's not very useful for creating publication-quality charts quickly and easily. As Chris Moffitt points out in his overview of Python visualization tools, matplotlib “is extremely powerful but with that power comes complexity.”

matplotlib has long been criticized for its default styles, which have a distinct 1990s feel. It’s current release of matplotlib 3.4.3 still reflects this style.
